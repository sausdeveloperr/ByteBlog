ByteBlog is a personal blog web application built with Node.js, Express.js, EJS and (my CSS). Its primary goal is to enable users to create, view, edit, and delete blog posts in a simple, responsive interface. No database is used; posts are stored temporarily in memory for learning purposes, emphasizing core backend and frontend skills. The styling was well focused to ensure a clean user experience across devices. This project is a part of my web dev Udemy capstone projects, designed to showcase my ability to develop a full-stack, dynamic web app using popular JavaScript tools.
